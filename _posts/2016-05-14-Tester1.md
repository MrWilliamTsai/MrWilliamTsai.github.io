<h1> Learning How to use Headings </h1>


<p> Today is a really pleasant afternoon where I learn how to code. This is still in winter semester however, I'm going to take advantage of the time I have to use. </p>

<p> In this sentence I'm going to make <b> Bold </b> </p>
<p> there will be a part of <i> <b> Italics </b> </i> in this sentence </p>
	^You can use bold and italics togather in HTML


<p> David's birthday is on October 3<sup>rd</sup> </p>
 ^This is an example of using supercript 

 <p> currently, I'm a chemistry tutor at QAHS - we learn about the reactions between H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> </p> 

 <h2> This is a secondary heading - Now I am learning about breaks </h2>

<p> The sky is very <br /> Blue today <br /> and it is very hard to look upwards </p>

<p> This is where I will insert a line - <strong> This is called a Horizontal Rule </strong> </p> <hr /> <p> between two parts of what I am writing today </p>


<h2> Semantic Markup and Emphasis/Strong </h2>
<p> <Strong> CAUTION: </Strong> my grandma has very great tasting soup </p>
<p> You need to <strong> Focus </strong> in order to achieve what you wish to <strong> achieve </strong> in life </p>

<p> Chapter 2 - Emphasis </p>
<p> I <em> think </em> I really need to focus on what is positive in life </p>
<p> sometimes the most <em> simple </em> things are the <em> greatest </em> things 

<p> Chapter 2 - "Quotations"/blockquote </p>

<blockquote cite = "https://myoneshotblog.wordpress.com/"> 
<p> Growth or consistently improving myself at something </p>
</blockquote>

<p> As Will said about his life, <q> Getting better at something I love or enjoy, really beings happiness to my life</q> </p>
